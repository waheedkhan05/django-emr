I am a medical doctor and am developing a small to medium clinic EMR. I do not aim to make it a Hospital Information System.

I have developed the Patient Contact Management aspect of the application and will be starting other aspects soon.

I have chosen Django as the development tool.

I would be happy to have other developers on board if interest is shown.

I will upload the code soon..
